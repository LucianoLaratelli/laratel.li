## Other

I completed eighteen credit hours in the Ph.D. Chemistry program at USF between
August 2018 and May 2019, focusing on research in computational chemistry. I
decided to transfer into the Computer Science program sometime during the spring
of 2019, and began taking classes for that degree that summer.

# Other Work Experience

## Apple (retail)

- Technical Specialist => Technical Expert
- July 2019 -> November 2020
- Tampa, FL

I worked at the Genius Bar, doing assessment and resolution of software issues
that occurred with Apple's mobile offerings: iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. In
February of 2020 I was promoted to `Technical Expert`, which added physical
repairs on iPhones to my responsibilities. I was consistently in the top five
employees for troubleshooting sessions completed per hour and lowest average
session duration. I also assisted the most customers out of anyone on the team
in the fourth quarter of 2019.

## University of South Florida Department of Chemistry

- Graduate Teaching Assistant
- August 2018 -> May 2019
- Tampa, FL

I worked as a Lab TA for the General Chemistry I lab, where I was responsible
for teaching students semester basic and intermediate experimental chemistry
techniques, as well as the chemical theory behind the experiments performed.
Taught students the basics of data analysis and reporting.Responsible for
teaching students proper laboratory safety techniques and ensuring their safety
at all times in the lab. This position required the communication of ideas using
distinct methods, handling multiple tasks at once, and managing groups of people
to reach a common goal.

## University of South Florida Space Lab

- Undergraduate Researcher => Graduate Researcher
- September 2016 -> May 2019
- Tampa, FL

I worked in Dr. Brian Space's lab, where I was responsible for conducting
independent computational chemistry research, mentoring undergraduates, and
contributing to the lab’s code base, a program called `mpmc`. I Designed and
implemented a parallel [end-to-end testing
suite](https://github.com/mpmccode/mpmc_testing) for the lab’s code base that
supports serial and parallel testing. I improved the lab's code base by
refactoring important sections, adjusting the build system to achieve
cross-platform compilation, increasing output functionality, and constructing
and adding a new set of simulation parameters.

## University of South Florida Leahy Lab

- Undergraduate Researcher
- August 2015 -> August 2016
- Tampa, FL

I worked as an undergraduate researcher in Dr. James Leahy's lab, under the
direction of Zach Shultz. I performed basic labwork in organic chemistry,
including titrations, spectroscopic analysis, and purification of novel
compounds. Eventually I began doing more advanced reactions, more difficult
separations chemistry, and natural products extraction.

## University of Miami Miller School of Medicine Podack Lab

- Undergraduate Researcher
- May 2014 -> August 2014
- Miami, FL

I worked as a (very green) undergraduate in the lab of Dr. Eckhard Podack. I
started with doing basic cell culture, mostly on agar plates, and eventually
transitioned to more advanced cultures and working with animal models
(particularly mice), where I studied the effects of a novel anticancer drug
intended to treat lung cancer.
