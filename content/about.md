*See also my [CV](/cv).*

I'm a software engineer and developer in Miami Beach. My technical interests
include functional programming, especially in Clojure, as well as herding Linux
servers -- I maintain a small homelab and some web services on the public
internet. I'm an Emacs enthusiast but I use vim keybindings.

My hobbies include running, walking our dog Delta, and reading. I read a lot of
sci-fi and Late-Victorian crime fiction along with more modern American novels.
I love music and listen mostly to Jazz, hip-hop, and R&B/Neo-Soul. Some of my
favorite musicians are D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Herbie Hancock, Bill Evans, Grant
Green, Jay-Z, A Tribe Called Quest, and MF DOOM.

I am a first-generation (US) American; my parents immigrated from Peru and
Argentina before I was born. 

I use [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), [neat.css](https://neat.joeldare.com/),
and [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/) to put this site together. It's
hosted on [fly.io](https://fly.io/).
