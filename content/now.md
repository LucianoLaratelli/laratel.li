I've been living in Miami Beach since November 2021. 

I'm finishing up the Couch to 5K running program! The app I got has nine weeks
and I have the last day of that last week on Wednesday the 13th. My latest run
was at exactly six minutes per kilometer which I'm very happy about.

After over six months of
[unemployment](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/luciano-laratelli-663851a1_i-was-unfortunately-part-of-the-layoffs-at-activity-7103053841058680832-c3Dm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
(with some consulting sprinkled in) I have gotten a job! I start on the 18th.

I've just finished a re-read of the six original Dune books and am considering
reading the two follow-up ones Brian Herbert wrote just to learn what happens.
