_Disclaimer: like a lot of online personal finance content, this post contains assumptions inherent to the privileged financial perspective of folks with a certain income. In the United States, that's generally referred to as wages being in the "upper two quintiles" of income._

Emergency funds are one of the first steps to getting your financial life together, and are a cornerstone of any budget. The initial steps for organizing your financial life generally include:

- figure out where your money is currently going (track expenses)
- figure out where your money needs to go (budget for necessities)
- figure out where you want your money to go (budget for nice-to-haves)
- protect yourself against financial emergencies
- prepare for the future (invest)

Most discussion online on the "prepare for emergencies" point generally follows some variation of what's recommended in the personal finance subreddit sidebar:

1.  Save a nominal amount of cash (say, $1000) before you do anything else. This is especially critical for those in unstable financial situations, as it may prevent the bleeding from an emergency that would normally lead to credit card or other high-interest debt.
2.  Follow the other steps. Set up a budget after tracking expenses.
3.  Save up N months of income. N is often suggested to be between 3 and 6, but some folks do up to a year's worth or more.[^1]

Once someone gets to this point, they're doing pretty well with their financial life. A lot of folks stop here! When, say, their car needs a big repair, they pull from their emergency fund, then replenish it. This works pretty well given that they're already used to saving, but I see some problems with this approach.

First, targeting a "number" makes it likely that people stop saving at that point. You set an emergency fund target of 12000, save 500 a month for two years, and then what? The next move may be to invest that money, or maybe treat yourself to a "raise" of a hundred or two bucks a month in a nice-to-have budget category and invest the difference. If you're disciplined enough to invest it all, you can easily stop that investment and recoup your emergency fund when you have to pull from it. Treating yourself, though, may make that harder: it's not always easy to give nice things up!

I don't think that someone disciplined enough to amass a sizable emergency fund would struggle too much on that point, though. The second problem I see with this approach is that it invites bad luck. Let's say you own your car, have a pet, and also own your apartment. If you have an emergency with any one of these three, a sizable emergency fund should easily weather the storm and you should have little trouble replenishing it after the fact. The trouble comes when it doesn't rain but instead pours -- your car breaks down the same week you learn that you have to replace your electrical panel. Now we may be talking significant portions of your fund. Still recoverable, but you're left much more vulnerable to other things your emergency fund should protect from, like layoffs.

I think a mature personal finance strategy should handle emergencies by applying
a concept experienced personal finance folks are already great at -- predicting
expenses then budgeting for them -- over longer timescales. This is a shift in
mindset from "every unexpected expense over $XXX is an emergency" to "I can
anticipate and plan for even large expenses." After you amass N months of
salary, you can continue budgeting for large predicted expenditures. Let's say
your car has 40,000 miles on it and you drive 10,000 miles a year. Automatic
transmissions enter the Failure Zone at 80,000 miles.[^2] If you know a
transmission replacement for the type of car you have is $5000, you can save for
it... starting now. That's a little over $100 a month, but _it's money you're
going to have to spend anyways_. Now when your transmission goes you can pay for
it in cash without touching your emergency fund.

I don't think this is a novel insight -- common wisdom around homeownership, for
example, is to save between 1 and 2% of your house's purchase price per year for
maintenance. But I often see (in personal finance forums) discussions around
"how do I replenish my emergency fund" where the emergency in question was
something that they could've budgeted for preemptively.[^3]
